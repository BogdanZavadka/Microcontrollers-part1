Lab 6

1. According to the task option (table 1), collect simulations in a package
Proteus scheme and write programs to implement the specified
task.
2. Develop a client program for managing the MK system.
3. Test the operation of the client program with the scheme in Proteus.
4. Present the results to the teacher.

1. Based on the RS485 network developed in the 8th laboratory work (one ATmega2560 and two ATmega328P) + CRC,
design a system for collecting data from end sensors,
that are connected to MK-Slave.
2. Develop a client program (C++, C#, JavaScript) and
write the program code that will implement it
communication between the computer and MK "master" and will display
received data from sensors.
