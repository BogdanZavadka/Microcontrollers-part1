1. According to the task option (table 1), collect simulations in a package
Proteus circuit based on MK ATmega2560 and write a program
in the Assembler language in Atmel Studio to implement the specified task.
2. Fill the program in Arduino-Kit.
3. Present the results to the teacher

1. Two sets of LEDs according to pressing the corresponding button
the specified algorithms work and go out. With
algorithms can work independently of each other.
Pressing the corresponding button restarts the specified algorithm,
which now works, first.
2. Time intervals are measured using timers, at
work in the main program is performed in parallel with this.
3. When the buttons are pressed, a buzzer signal sounds.
4. The program must be written in the Assembler language.

Variant:
Buttons: PL4, PL6
LEDs: portA, portF
Delay: 0,65s
Timer: 3
Algorithms: 6, 8

Algorithm 6:
After pushing the button LEDs start blinking like this: P7 -> P5 -> P3 -> P1 -> P6 -> P4 -> P2 -> P0

Algorithm 8:
After pushing the button LEDs start blinking like this: P7 -> P0 -> P6 -> P1 -> P5 -> P2 -> P4 -> P3
