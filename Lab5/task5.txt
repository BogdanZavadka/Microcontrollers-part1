Lab 5

1. According to the task option (table 1), collect simulations in a package
Proteus scheme and write programs to implement the specified
task.
2. Develop a client program for managing the MK system.
3. Test the operation of the client program with the scheme in Proteus.
4. Fill the programs in Arduino-Kits.
5. Present the results to the teacher.

1. Design a schematic diagram of the data exchange system
between the microcontroller network (one ATmega2560 and two
ATmega328P) based on RS-485 interface and personal
computer;
2. Develop an exchange protocol between microcontrollers
"master" and "slave" networks based on RS-485, as well as between
Windows client program and MC "master" (RS-232);
CRC checksums must be present in the protocol
(Table 2).
3. For MK "master" and "slave" write program code that
will implement the task:
 1st Slave sends the student's "Surname and Patronymic Name";
 2nd Slave sends "Date of birth" of the student;
Duplicate these messages 5 times with the information entered in them
distortions according to the variant of the task.
4. Develop a client program (C++, C#, JavaScript) and
write the program code that will implement it
communication between the computer and MK "master" and will display
and will analyze the received data from MK "slave" for availability
transmission errors.

Variant:
RS-485: speed 38400
RS-232: speed 38400
Slaves' addresses: 23, 54
CRC: CRC8/DARC(table) for every 1 bite of data
List of distortions:
1) without distortions
2) 0th digit of the oldest data byte of Slave1
3) 3rd digit of the youngest data byte of Slave2
4) 3rd and 7th digits of the 2nd byte of Slave2 data
5) 0, 2, 5 digits of the 4th byte of Slave1 data
