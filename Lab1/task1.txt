Lab 1

1. According to the task variant, assemble a circuit based on the ATmega2560 IC in the Proteus simulation package and write a C++ program in the Arduino IDE to implement the specified algorithm.
2. Fill the program in Arduino-Kit.
3. Present the results to the teacher.

Variant:
Button pin: PL6;
LEDs: port-A
Delay: 0,65s
Algorithm: 6

Algorithm 6:
After pushing the button LEDs start blinking like this: P7 -> P5 -> P3 -> P1 -> P6 -> P4 -> P2 -> P0
