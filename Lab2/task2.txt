Lab 2

1. According to the task variant, assemble a circuit based on the ATmega2560 IC in the Proteus simulation package and write a C++ program in the Arduino IDE to implement the specified task.
2. Develop a client program for managing MK.
3. Test the operation of the client program with the scheme in Proteus.
4. Fill the program in Arduino-Kit.
5. Present the results to the teacher.

1. It is necessary for the client program to communicate with Proteus
set a pair of virtual COM ports.
2. Algorithms with LEDs are running
by pressing the appropriate buttons on the client form.
3. When you press the buttons on the MK, the corresponding ones are launched
algorithms for flashing icons on the client form.

Variant:
Button pin: PL6;
LEDs: port-A
Delay: 0,65s
Algorithm: 6, 8

Algorithm 6:
After pushing the button LEDs start blinking like this: P7 -> P5 -> P3 -> P1 -> P6 -> P4 -> P2 -> P0

Algorithm 8:
After pushing the button LEDs start blinking like this: P7 -> P0 -> P6 -> P1 -> P5 -> P2 -> P4 -> P3
